            <p>This is my final project for Flatiron Bootcamp I have used my the skills I have been taught to produce this app. This app is just a way for gamers to rate any games they have played and leave their thoughts so other people can see if the game is right for them or not. The name Shelf Warmers is just a play on the phrase 'bench warmers' as bad players sit on the bench, bad games sit on a shelf.</p>
